SublimeLinter-erlc 1.3.0
------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE!  All the recognized settings have been renamed to match
the name on the command line.

T.i.

    `include_dirs` -> `I`
    `pa_dirs` -> `pa`
    `pz_dirs` -> `pz`
    `output_dir` -> `o`

You can also just use the setting `args` for all the things or any other
flag you might wanna set.
